# CNN
This is a bare bones convolutional neural network written in C.

There is no fancy libraries used here, just math.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, float.h, time.h. I wrote this in part to deepen my understanding of ML but also as a bit of a challenge.

This currently uses MNIST dataset for handwritten digits. However, it can take any image dataset that comes in a csv format. 

Docs for usage is in the top of CNN.c. Feel free to copy/clone/use if interested.
